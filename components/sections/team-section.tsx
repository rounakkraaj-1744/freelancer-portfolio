              Sometimes one person isn't enough (even if that person is pretty awesome ðŸ˜‰). For bigger projects, I bring

              Here's the thing about our <span className="text-primary font-semibold">annual partnership model</span>:
              We don't just build your software and disappear. We become your dedicated tech team for a full year. We
              handle everything â€” development, infrastructure, scaling, hiring additional developers when needed,
              maintenance, updates, the works.

              Your company gets to focus entirely on what you do best: marketing, sales, and growing the business. We
              take care of all the technical stuff. It's like having an entire tech department without the overhead of
              hiring, managing, and retaining a full team.

              We've helped companies go from startup to scale-up, and established businesses modernize their entire tech
              stack. The best part? You get experienced professionals who already work well together, not a random
              collection of freelancers figuring things out as they go.
